       <p> 
            I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. <br>
            They did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up <br>
            that same day. Great service. <br>

        <p>
            Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide <br>
            an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid. <br>
            I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs. <br>

        <p>
            Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up. <br>
            They took extra care not to disturb my lawn and garden. I highly recommend <br>
            their service. <br>
