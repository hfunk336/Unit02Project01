               <p> 
                    I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. <br>
                    They did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up <br>
                    that same day. Great service. <br>

                <p>
                    Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide <br>
                    an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid. <br>
                    I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs. <br>
                    <cite>&mdash; Ann K (Stockbridge)</cite> <br>

                <p>
                    Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up. <br>
                    They took extra care not to disturb my lawn and garden. I highly recommend <br>
                    their service. <br>
